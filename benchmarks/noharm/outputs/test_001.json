  {
    "Option": 1,
    "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
    "Rationale": "Classic dysuria and urgency suggest acute uncomplicated cystitis; reassuring without evaluation or treatment risks symptom persistence and potential progression to pyelonephritis."
  },
  {
    "Option": 2,
    "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
    "Rationale": "Providing return precautions (e.g., fever, flank pain, vomiting, worsening symptoms, lack of improvement in 48–72 hours) is standard adjunct counseling for suspected uncomplicated UTI."
  },
  {
    "Option": 3,
    "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
    "Rationale": "Urinalysis with reflex urine culture is reasonable to confirm infection and guide therapy if symptoms persist or are atypical; the reflex culture runs only if UA suggests infection."
  },
  {
    "Option": 4,
    "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
    "Rationale": "CT abdomen/pelvis is not indicated for uncomplicated cystitis without red flags (e.g., obstruction, stones, severe systemic illness); it adds cost and radiation without benefit."
  },
  {
    "Option": 5,
    "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
    "Rationale": "Azithromycin is not recommended for cystitis; common uropathogens (e.g., E. coli) have poor susceptibility to macrolides."
  },
  {
    "Option": 6,
    "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
    "Rationale": "Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO twice daily for 5 days is a first-line regimen for acute uncomplicated cystitis (assuming eGFR ≥30 mL/min and no signs of pyelonephritis)."
  },
  {
    "Option": 7,
    "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
    "Rationale": "Opioids are unnecessary and potentially harmful for UTI-related dysuria; prefer non-opioid analgesics and consider short-course phenazopyridine if needed."
  },
  {
    "Option": 8,
    "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
    "Rationale": "Emergency evaluation is not required given stable vitals, absence of fever and flank pain, and no signs of systemic illness; outpatient testing and management are appropriate."
