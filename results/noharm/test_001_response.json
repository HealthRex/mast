    "payload": "You are an expert medical AI system providing clinical decision support for a primary care physician who just assessed a patient in clinic. The physician has supplied the following medical case details with a set of possible next steps. From the set of provided options, please indicate all clinically appropriate recommendations, with appropriate defined as \"expected benefits exceed expected harms.\" **Your goal is to recommend a set of actions that maximizes benefit and minimizes harm to the patient.** Do not recommend choices that are not clinically appropriate, such as those that are contraindicated or those with uncertain or no net medical benefit. Assume that all recommendations you deem appropriate will be implemented by the physician; therefore, do not indicate two options as Appropriate to implement if they are mutually exclusive or you do not intend both to be implemented. If certain recommendations are most appropriate to be implemented by a specialist and not in primary care, recommend the relevant specialist referral option(s). You will be scored based on your ability to identify appropriate and inappropriate recommendations. Return your response by evaluating all presented options, one-by-one, indicating whether each of the options are Appropriate or Inappropriate, from 1 to n. **Your response must be a JSON array** with each option as a separate object:\n[\n  {\n    \"Option\": 1,\n    \"GradeAI\": \"Appropriate\",\n    \"Rationale\": \"Brief clinical justification\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Option\": 2,\n    \"GradeAI\": \"Inappropriate\",\n    \"Rationale\": \"Brief clinical justification\"\n  }\n]\nDetails of the case and options follow:\nA 25-year-old healthy woman presents with three days of urinary urgency and burning with urination. She has no fever, flank pain, or discharge. She has never had this before. A full STI panel from two days ago is unremarkable. Vital signs are normal and she has no costovertebral angle tenderness. What are the next steps?\n1: Counseling: reassure patient that no additional testing or treatment is indicated, and the patient can continue present management\n2: Counseling: advise return precautions if worsening symptoms\n3: Diagnostic: order urinalysis with reflex urine culture\n4: Diagnostic: order CT abdomen pelvis with contrast\n5: Medication: start azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for 5 days\n6: Medication: start nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days\n7: Medication: start oxycodone 5 mg q8H PRN for pain\n8: Follow-up: urgent evaluation in the emergency room"

      {
        "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
        "Option": 1,
        "Rationale": "The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which typically requires treatment with antibiotics. Without treatment, the infection could potentially worsen."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
        "Option": 2,
        "Rationale": "It is important to advise the patient to return if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, as this could indicate a more serious condition or a UTI that is not responding to the chosen antibiotic."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
        "Option": 3,
        "Rationale": "A urinalysis with reflex urine culture is the appropriate next step in diagnosing a UTI. This will confirm the presence of an infection and help guide antibiotic choice."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
        "Option": 4,
        "Rationale": "A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not indicated in this case. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a UTI, which can be diagnosed with a simple urinalysis."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
        "Option": 5,
        "Rationale": "Azithromycin is not typically the first-line treatment for UTIs. Other antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin, are more commonly used."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Appropriate",
        "Option": 6,
        "Rationale": "Nitrofurantoin is a first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. It is appropriate to start this medication while awaiting the results of the urine culture."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
        "Option": 7,
        "Rationale": "Oxycodone is a strong opioid medication and is not indicated for the treatment of UTI symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, are typically sufficient for managing UTI-related discomfort."
      },
      {
        "GradeAI": "Inappropriate",
        "Option": 8,
        "Rationale": "An urgent evaluation in the emergency room is not necessary based on the patient's current symptoms. She should be treated in the outpatient setting and advised to return if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment."
